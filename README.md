## ‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up

The backend is hosted on a free service, so it may **sleep when idle**. This means the **first request might take a few seconds** to wake up.  
All features still work, but the **daily survival cards may refresh earlier than intended** when the server restarts.  
For the smoothest experience, clone the repo and run the backend locally.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Guide

### Frontend (React + Vite)

1. Clone the repo:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AntoOfo/survivr-web
   cd survivr-web
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   npm install
    ```
3. Update the fetch URLs in your frontend code to point to your backend.
   
4. Run the app locally:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
    ```

### Backend (Spring Boot - Java 17)

1. Navigate to **survivr-backend/**.
   
2. Add your API keys in **src/main/resources/application.properties**:
   
   ```bash
   groq.api.key=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
   pexels.api.key=YOUR_PEXELS_API_KEY
    ```
3. (Optional) Remove or adjust any **@CrossOrigin** settings if you plan to run locally.
   
4. Run locally:
   ```bash
   mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```
